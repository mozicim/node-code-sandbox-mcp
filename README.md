Welcome to the Node Code Sandbox MCP! This repository provides a secure Node.js execution environment tailored for AI applications. It allows coding agents and large language models (LLMs) to run JavaScript dynamically, install NPM packages, and retrieve results. This functionality facilitates code generation, testing, and interactive assistance, all while adhering to the Model Control Protocol (MCP).
